## Stagger effect from AnimeJS
#### This is a simple example of how to use AnimeJS to create a stagger effect.

### How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click anywhere on the page to start the animation
4. Click again to stop the animation

### How it works
The `anime` function takes a class selector and the animation properties. 
The function is called for each element in the array.
We use `grid` to position the elements correctly on the page and the clientWidth and clientHeight to get the size of the body.
